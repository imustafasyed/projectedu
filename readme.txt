# Welcome

To My GitHub space which brings together my interests in higher education, human-computer interaction (HCI), and project management.

## What you'll find here
- HCI work: prototypes, usability-focused designs, and interaction experiments  
- Higher education projects: learning tools, research-inspired builds, and reflections  
- Project management artifacts: frameworks, templates, and lightweight automations  

## How I approach work
I like building things that are clear, useful, and grounded in real user needs. I aim to balance thoughtful design with practical execution, from early discovery through delivery.

## Connect
If you’re interested in collaborating or exchanging ideas in higher education, HCI, or project delivery, feel free to reach out.
