Hello, Explorer of Ideas!
Welcome to my GitHub Corner — where higher education meets creativity, HCI sparks curiosity, and project management keeps the chaos charmingly organized.
I’m passionate about understanding how people learn, how they interact with technology, and how thoughtful systems (and good coffee) can bring complex projects to life.
What You’ll Find Here

 HCI Experiments — interfaces, prototypes, and designs inspired by real human behavior
 Higher Ed Insights — tools, visualizations, and reflections on learning experiences
 Project Management Goodies — dashboards, frameworks, and neat little automations

 My Work Style
Curious. Empathetic. Organized.
Think researcher energy, UX brain, and PM-level color-coded spreadsheets.
 Let’s Connect
If you enjoy building meaningful experiences, redesigning the way people learn, or just love a good user flow — you’re in the right place.
Pull up a chair, click around, and feel free to reach out!
